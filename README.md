This is the WOTC edition of my XCOM 2 mod that adds a panel of five buttons to the Customize Soldier Info submenu: the buttons allow the user to tap into the in-game functions and generate new random names (first, last, and nicknames), a different country, and a new biography at their whim.

There's a config file that allows the user to reposition the button panel if they choose, and rather verbose instructions on just how that works.

It supports all of the new classes as well as SPARKs but as a result requries the associated DLC for both.

It's on Steam Workshop here:
