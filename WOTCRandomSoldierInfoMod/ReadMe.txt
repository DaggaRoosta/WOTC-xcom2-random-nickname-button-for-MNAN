THIS IS THE WOTC EDITION.

Have you ever known a soldier's nickname was wrong, but you couldn't think of the right one? This happens to me all the time in XCOM and I've really wanted a "Random Nickname" button all throughout EU/EW/LW. Well, now I got the chance to make one. Enjoy! 

This mod adds five buttons to the Character Info screen: 
* Random First Name 
* Random Last Name 
* Random Nickname 
* Random Country 
* Random Bio 

The buttons call the built-in generators and thus *should* use whatever lists you have, modified or stock. (If they don't, let me know.) 

Names are generated with respect to gender and country of origin, as it's the stock randomization functions the mod is using to generate them. 

A newly generated name or country will be reflected in the existing bio. 

In-game nicknames can only be generated if the soldier is of rank to have one. Using the Character Pool or a mod to make lower rank soldiers nicknameable won't (yet) allow this mod to do the same, I'm afraid. 

FAQ 

"Help! When I click the Nickname button, it doesn't work! OR it erases my operative's nickname!" 

If a soldier doesn't have a class, they can't get a nickname from the built-in generator function, because each class has its own random nickname list. If your soldier's not yet a Squaddie, you can't random gen them a nickname even with the Full Customization Mod. If you're in the Character Pool, assign the soldier a class and it will work. :) 

"Your mod doesn't work with [mod]!" 

Most incompatibilities are due to the other modder is instantiating their own Customization menu rather than extending the existing one. Their custom menu will have a different (arbitrary) name that mine won't be able to pick up on. If you *really* want to, you can fork my project and have it extend your favorite mod's main class and it might just work. (Buyer beware.)

KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES. 

The default override for soldier stance is lost upon clicking one of my buttons (i.e. they'll resume acting wounded if they are wounded). (No workaround.) 

The Random Bio button's label isn't left justified correctly along with the others. This should be the easiest one to fix...but it's not. (Workaround: grimace slightly and shake your head, as I do.)

It doesn't work with SPARK soldiers. This is on my todo list. Still.
